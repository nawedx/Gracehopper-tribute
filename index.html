    <ul>
      <li>Grace Hopper was one of the pioneers in the early days of electronic computers. She and her team invented A-0, the world’s first compiler.</li>
      <li><strong>1906 - </strong>Grace Brewster Murray was born on December 9, 1906 in New York City, USA. Hopper was her married surname.</li>
      <li><strong>1924 - </strong>Grace matriculated at Vassar College, a private liberal arts college in Poughkeepsie, New York.</li>
       <li><strong>1928 - </strong>Grace enjoyed academia and win a Vassar scholarship and it took her to graduate school at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.</li>
       <li><strong>1931 - </strong>She was delighted to accept work as a mathematics assistant at Vassar College and decided to take a fresh approach to courses and incorporated ideas from other subjects such as chemistry. Her new approach was rewarded with surge in the number of students taking maths courses.</li>
      <li><strong>1943 - </strong>Hopper joined the Naval Reserve after applying successfully for a waiver on her weight. She trained at the Women's Midshipman School in Northampton, Massachusetts.</li>
      <li><strong>1944 - </strong>She achieved the highest rank - battalion commander - and graduated first in her class in June.</li>
      <li><strong>1945 - </strong>fter graduation, Lieutenant Grace Hopper was assigned to Commander Howard Aiken’s Computation Laboratory at Harvard University, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</li>
      <li><strong>1947 - </strong>A moth landed in one of the Mark II computer’s mechanical relays, causing the relay to fail. Someone removed the moth, so the computer was ‘debugged.’ The word already existed in computing, but Hopper and her colleagues thought it was hilarious that they were the first people to literally debug a computer.</li>
      <li><strong>1949 - </strong>Hopper left the Navy to become Senior Mathematician at an exciting new company in Philadelphia started by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, the computer scientists who, during the war, had built ENIAC, one of the world’s first electronic general-purpose computers. </li>
      <li><strong>1952 - </strong>Hopper and her team invented the world’s first compiler, the A-0 system.</li>
      <li><strong>1959 - </strong>Computer scientists from government and industry got together and defined the needs of a new computing language to be known as COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language). Grace Hopper was the committee’s technical consultant.</li>
      <li><strong>1969 - </strong>The Data Processing Management Association instituted a new award, the Computer Science Man-of-the-Year award; its first winner was Grace Hopper.</li>
      <li><strong>1973 - </strong>Grace Hopper was awarded The Legion of Merit.</li>
      <li><strong>1983 - </strong>Many of Hopper’s awards came in 1983 or later, particularly honorary doctorates. Until then, she had been largely unheard of outside computer science, but a lively appearance on CBS’s 60 minutes captured the nation’s imagination and made her famous overnight.

</li>
      <li><strong>1986 - </strong>As her father had predicted in 1910, Grace Hopper lived to see Halley’s Comet return in 1986. Coincidentally, 1986 was the year she finally retired, age 79, from the Navy, where she was known as “Amazing Grace.” She never fully retired from computing and worked as an industry consultant to the end of her life.</li>
      <li><strong>1991 - </strong>She received America’s highest technology award, The National Medal of Technology, from President George Bush.</li>
      <li><strong>1992 - </strong>Grace Hopper died in her sleep, age 85, of natural causes, on January 1, 1992 in Berkeley, California. She was buried with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia. </li>
       <li><strong>1997 - </strong>The Navy named a new guided-missile destroyer in her honor: USS Hopper.</li>
